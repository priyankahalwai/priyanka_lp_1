The mode of development I prefer and the planning for the app/website are:

1)I would be more agile and whould take everyday decisions which is more inclined to time to market even though compromising other constraints

2)I would be well informed with the company strategy/target market and relate it very closely with the objectives of the project. Even though this requirement is present in all projects it is really mandatory in a startup.

3)I would visionize the team to look beyond the project and understand where the startup is heading few years down the line.

4) A startup surely requires the manager to get the hands dirty rather than just driving the plane from 10000 ft. So, getting hands dirty on projects would be my strategy.
